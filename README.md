**Introduction**\
I have designed elective advisory system in prolog for MTech students of IIIT Delhi.\
The specializations used to fetch the interest field of the user are as follows.\
The specializations used to fetch the interest field of the user are as follows:
1. Artificial Intelligence
2. Mobile Computing
3. Data Engineering
4. Information Security

Using these **specializations**, I have created facts that show the electives of the corresponding specialization field. But for detecting whether the user is good in it or not, I have used the condition that if the user had done two or more than two courses in that field and if their GPA in that courses is more significant than equal to 8, then only suggest complementary field electives to them.\
For **Future career advice**, I asked questions regarding their interest in competitive programming, Research, Engineer role for the job , his/her current GPA , any internship done and based on the answers given by user, I advise him/her what to do in future.
